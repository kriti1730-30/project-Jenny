Jenny is a full-stack web-based programming platform that combines a custom-built language with an interactive browser-based code editor. Designed with simplicity and learning in mind, Jenny offers an approachable way to explore core programming concepts without unnecessary complexity.

The backend is powered by a lightweight C++ interpreter that processes code in real time, while the frontend features a responsive editor that allows users to write, run, and manage code effortlessly within their browser. Jenny supports essential programming constructs such as variables, conditionals, loops, and file operations, making it suitable for both beginners and prototype development.

Key Highlights
-Web-Based Code Editor
Users can write and execute code directly in their browser, with no setup required.

-Custom Language Engine
A C++ interpreter handles the execution of a clean, minimal programming language designed to focus on logic, not syntax.

-Time Travel Debugging
Jenny includes a unique undo feature that allows users to revert previous variable assignments. This "time travel" capability enhances learning by helping users explore the effect of changes step by step.


Version Control for Sessions
Each code session tracks the state of variables and their changes, providing a lightweight version control mechanism. This helps users understand how their program evolves over time and makes experimentation safer.

Jenny is ideal for learning environments, experimentation, or anyone interested in understanding how programming languages and interpreters workâ€”from the inside out. It creates a safe, guided space where users can iterate, experiment, and grow their programming confidence.
